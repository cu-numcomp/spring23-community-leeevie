## Software: *Calculate Root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of Two Molecules Using Rotation*

This software determines the structural differences (or similarity) between two molecules. It calculates the optimal rotational matrix to minimize the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), which is often used to calculate the differences between modeled and observed values. It uses either the [Kabsch algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabsch_algorithm) (which uses SVD) or the [Quarternion algorithm](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/1049-9660(91)90036-o) to calculate the rotation matrix. Due to its application on molecules, the primary audience is those in cheminformatics (comparing molecular structure) or bioinformatics (comparing protein structures) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabsch_algorithm); this repo is also featured under "External Links").
